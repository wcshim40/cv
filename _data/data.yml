  details: |
   + **Bio and Research Interests**
      + Although my major is a little bit far from cybersecurity, after I joined Samsung Research, I have been enjoying cybersecurity until now. I am currently working as a project leader for automated software vulnerability analysis.    
      + My research work covers a range of topics: **software obfuscation**, **network security** for IoT devices, **security development lifecycle**, automated software **vulnerability analysis**, and **threat intelligence**.        
      + Currently, I am interested in synthesizing fuzz drivers automatically and expanding their applications (libraries, device drivers, firmware, etc.).
